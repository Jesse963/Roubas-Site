            <h3 id="kids">Kids Classes</h3>
            <p>
              Our junior program is targeted at children between the ages of 8
              to 13yrs old. Children of this age require a high degree of
              dynamics, both in physical and mental challenges as they are able
              to understand the basic fundamentals of movement, balance,
              coordination and memory.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our karate curriculum focuses on traditional teachings and family
              values where respect and etiquette are of the utmost importance
              yet allowing the classes to be high energy with self-control and
              motivation training.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our grading method using the belt system will allow the students
              to learn the importance of goal setting as well as traditional
              values such as courtesy and respect.
            </p>

            <p>
              As students develop, they will become confident and focused and
              this will reflect on other areas of their lives outside the dojo.
              They will soon discover the ability to speak in public with
              confidence and be able to focus their mind in their schooling
              environments. Students will learn the process of step by step
              learning, which will make them aware that anything is possible if
              they have the right attitude.

            <h3 id="adults">Adult Classes</h3>
            <p>
              Our dojo has been teaching karate for over 30 years and in that
              time we have come to know a lot about teaching our adult students.
              Firstly, we know that many adults wish they could do martial arts
              but think it’s too late to start. Karate is definitely not just
              for children. Most of these adult students have come with no
              previous experience in the martial arts. Whatever level of fitness
              or level of experience, our dojo’s are able to provide you with a
              unique environment to help you reach your goals.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our dojo’s cater for all members, from National Champions at an
              elite level, to the social karateka that trains for fitness and
              well-being. Our style of karate (Goju Ryu) uses many natural
              stances and less of the low strenuous stances of some other
              styles. This allows the practitioner to continue to train as they
              get older and not be limited by an aging body. Goju Ryu, like a
              fine wine is one of the rare styles of karate that allows you to
              get better with age.

          <section class="expectations">
            <h3 id="expectations">What to Expect</h3>
            <p class="intro text">
              We offer a <em> free introductory session</em> to all prospective
              members, simply come along to one of our training sessions. Here's
              a little of what you can expect:
            </p>

            <h4>Your first session</h4>
            <p>
              When you arrive one of the instructors will introduce themselves.
              They will give you the choice of watching a class or joining in.
              We recommend joining in as this is the best way to gauge if our
              dojo is right for you or your children. Before you start the
              instructor will normally ask you a few questions about your
              physical health and ability to participate in the class. They will
              also provide you with a membership form. There is no obligation to
              join.
            </p>

            <h4>What to bring?</h4>
            <p>
              If you think you might try it out, just wear a tee-shirt and
              shorts or track pants (do not wear jeans or any clothing that may
              restrict your movement). Also bring a bottle of water.
            </p>

            <h4>Karate Gi (Uniform)</h4>
            <p>
              Once you have completed your free trial class and have indicated
              that you would like to become a member of the dojo. You will
              receive your own Karate Gi inclusive of embroidery and a white
              belt. This is covered in the cost of registration.
            </p>

            <h4>How often you should train</h4>
            <p>
              Karate is just like everything else in life: what you get out of
              it depends on what you’re prepared to put in. So if you want to
              progress at a reasonable pace, we recommend you train a minimum of
              twice a week.
            </p>

            <h4>How the class is structured</h4>
            <p>
              With so many aspects to Karate, every class is different – which
              means the training stays fresh, interesting and challenging (both
              mentally and physically). However, every session starts with a
              warm-up and stretching exercises. You’ll then be taught various
              blocks, punches, strikes, kicks and stances. Don’t expect to do
              kumite (sparring) in your first class.
            </p>

            <h4>Grading and coloured belts</h4>
            <p>
              Nothing quite beats the sense of achievement that comes with
              earning each colour belt as you advance. And with Gradings
              (Examinations) held every three to four months, there are plenty
              of opportunities for you to do so. The grading’s are held under
              the supervision of a Senior Examiner and you’ll be taught the
              relevant Syllabus in advance, so you’ll be well prepared on the
              day.
            </p>

            <h4>Tournaments</h4>
            <p>
              In Karate, we often say the only person you’re competing with is
              yourself. On the other hand, there are plenty of Events you can
              enter or come along to watch. It’s completely up to you.
            </p>

            <h4>Events and other activities</h4>
            <p>
              Roubas Goju Ryu Karate is affiliated with the IKO (International
              Karate Organisation) in Tokyo Japan and has an international
              following throughout the world. There are often opportunities to
              participate in National and International Courses and Events
              throughout the year, as well as train with the most renowned
              Japanese, European and Australian Instructors. We hold our own
              training and social events too and you're welcome to attend any of
              them.
            </p>

          <section class="benefits">
            <h3 id="benefits">Benefits of Karate</h3>
            <h4>Karate is a Healthy Choice</h4>
            <p>
              Our purpose is to make sure that you work at a level that is
              comfortable, yet challenging to yourself. Our workouts consist of
              a good mixture of cardiovascular endurance, strength training and
              flexibility exercises that are designed to benefit the whole body.
              Our instructors continue to research the best training methods
              known to the fitness world, and we're serious about it. People
              feel good when their healthy. It may seem like a redundant
              statement, but it's something that people need reminding of. With
              a healthy body, you have a healthy mind. Everything from waking up
              in the morning, and thinking clearly at school or in our jobs in
              this fast paced society that we live in becomes easier to deal
              with and more enjoyable when your body and mind are in tune.
            </p>

            <h4>Awareness and Self Defence</h4>
            <p>
              The key to self defence does not rely entirely on punching and
              kicking. Learning to be aware of your surroundings and avoiding
              dangerous situations is the focus of awareness. Simple things that
              people probably already know are used as constant reminders so
              that awareness becomes a natural way of thinking. We don't want
              people to be paranoid or scared to walk around their own block or
              to go to school, but many bad situations can be avoided.
            </p>

            <h4>Concentration and Focus</h4>
            <p>
              Concentration is something that for many people, has to be taught.
              Many doctors are now recommending people with A.D.D. (Attention
              Deficit Disorder) and A.D.H.D. (Attention Deficit and Hearing
              Disorder) learn karate because of the concentration skills that
              are developed through the training drills and the practice of kata
              - a series of movements, much like a dance choreography with the
              use of karate techniques.
            </p>

            <h4>Balance</h4>
            <p>
              Balance is a physical, and mental attribute that is developed as a
              result of karate training. Balance in the physical sense is
              acquired by performing drills that make you aware of what your
              body is doing while in motion. Balance as a mental characteristic
              is developed as you use karate as a mental stimulant. For most
              people karate will not be as natural as walking so you will have
              to rationalize your movements as you learn them. With the presence
              of a good physical and mental balance you will enhance and develop
              your skills.
            </p>

            <h4>Control</h4>

            <p>
              Control is a result of focus, concentration, and confidence.
              Through the efforts of repetitive karate training people learn
              their limitations. The more aggressive person may want to push
              those limitations, which is not a bad thing, but they learn to
              deal with what they have in front of them. Emotions such as anger
              and fear may never leave a person completely but by practice, like
              anything else, you can learn to control them.
            </p>

            <h4>Respect, Discipline, and Humility</h4>
            <p>
              Most educated people associate karate with discipline. This is
              because of the format in which the classes are taught. In karate
              there is a ranking system which lets people know where they stand.
              Karate doesn't have to be militaristic to the point it was
              originally intended (after all it is a martial art developed to
              defend ones' life) but these values are instilled. Generally a
              person who enters a karate class will see that people will bow to
              each other, call the instructor Sensei (teacher) and conform to
              the rules and guidelines set forth by the club. This makes a
              person feel rather awkward themselves if they don't conform to
              their surroundings. If there is a problem child or an adult with
              an overbearing demeanour they will be dealt with on a personal
              level. Most difficult people can be taught humility simply by
              being in an environment where it is prominent.
            </p>

            <h4>Goal Orientation</h4>

            <p>
              People need direction. Most people enter a karate club with
              visions of wearing a black belt. The realization of reaching that
              goal can be overwhelming without proper direction. As instructors
              we help individuals set reasonable goals so that a person can make
              these ambitions attainable. Instead of thinking about a black belt
              that may be four years down the road, we focus on our ranking
              system which breaks it down to a few months at a time. At each
              level the student knows in advance what is expected of them to
              reach the next level. People that learn the importance of mile
              marking goals can more readily accept some of lifes challenges and
              learn to make realistic goals for themselves when there isn't
              someone there to do it for them.
            </p>

            <h4>Self Confidence</h4>
            <p>
              You have to feel good about yourself and you have to trust in your
              abilities to be confident. Karate teaches you how to handle
              pressure by applying a little bit at a time. Every individual has
              a certain limit and once you find it you feel comfortable. Once
              you're comfortable you can start to expand or push those limits
              and feel good about trying something you never imagined you could
              before. Karate is an endless learning experience that provides
              constant challenge keeping you alert and to let your confidence
              grow.
            </p>

            <h4>Role Models</h4>
            <p>
              Like a school teacher, we as karate instructors have a
              responsibility to our students to instil positive values. Children
              benefit by the mental stimulation of learning the choreographed
              moves of the kata and the discipline of conforming to the rules of
              the club. An adult doesn't have to feel self conscious about
              getting the physical benefits of the exercise provided. Karate
              instils the confidence to walk away from confrontation, not to
              contest it head on. To teach these values at an early age will
              benefit a child for the rest of their life. On an adult
              perspective, it can shed a bit of light through the stresses of
              our daily routines.
            </p>

            <h4>Constant Supervision & Guidance</h4>
            <p>
              Karate clubs, unlike many health clubs provide constant
              instruction by experienced leaders. Most people don't have the
              discipline to work out by themselves and it's human nature to work
              on what we already do well rather than to work at what is more
              difficult. By having the instructors lead a class through a
              planned routine you get a good balanced workout. Karate also
              promotes group support by having students work with each other
              under the guidance of an instructor. This teaches a more
              experienced student to work their leadership skills by passing
              along information that they have gathered over the years. A less
              experienced student will also ask questions that will challenge
              the senior student. This is a challenge that requires the senior
              student to put trust in their abilities and in return adds a real
              sense of accomplishment.
            </p>

            <h4>Karate as a Sport</h4>
            <p>
              Karate as a sport has been on a steady incline since the late
              1960s. It provides a method of testing your abilities in a
              controlled environment. The sparring is fast paced not only for
              the spectator, but requires precision skill and control by the
              competitor. In karate you pull your technique, scoring points by
              showing the judges what you could do in a self-defence situation.
              The kata competition shows a combination of grace and power in
              technique through a series of choreographed movements that
              represent the competitor defending themselves in a multi attack
              environment. Both provide a sense of self accomplishment and build
              confidence by performing in front of their peers and an audience.
            </p>

            <h4>Karate is Fun!</h4>
            <p>
              Not only do you benefit from learning the techniques and routines
              that karate provides, you do it with other people that share a
              common interest. Any extra curricular activity you involve
              yourself with should be a release from the stress or anxiety that
              is built up in our daily routines. People involved in karate can
              established friendships for life.
