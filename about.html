              Our style of martial arts is <em> Goju-Ryu Karate-Do</em>, a
              traditional Japanese martial art aimed to promote physical
              fitness, self-defence, body conditioning and improvement in mental
              attitude ultimately becoming a way of life.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our dojo’s are founded on the philosophy of maintaining a special
              sense of family, camaraderie and community among its members.
            </p>

            <p>
              Andrew Roubas established his dojo’s in 1984 in Sydney, Australia
              as an affiliated dojo of the IKO (International Karate
              Organisation) under the guidance of Gonnohyoe Yamamoto Soshihan
              (10th Dan). The IKO has an international presence with the main
              headquarters located in Tokyo, Japan.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our dojo’s offer classes that are disciplined, yet fun. They allow
              the whole family to participate and develop a unique bond with one
              another based on respect and good etiquette. Karate is an
              individual activity where students perform at their own level, yet
              the class operates as a group, with each member working not only
              to improve him or herself, but to assist the other members improve
              as well. This environment stimulates a healthy camaraderie and
              unity among its members.

            <p>
              The Goju-Ryu Karate method of training has four main components of
              instruction. The first and most basic is Kihon which deals with
              the fundamentals of blocking, striking kicking and stances.
            </p>

            <p>
              The second method is Kata. Kata or forms are precise sequence of
              moves that represent a battle with multiple opponents.
            </p>

            <p>
              Kumite is the third method of training where students learn to
              apply the techniques from Kihon & Kata.
            </p>

            <p>
              The final method of training is Kobudo Weapon training featuring
              traditional weapons of the Bo, Sai, Nunchaku and Sticks. Kobudo
              training is limited to high grades requiring an adequate
              understanding of Kihon, Kata & Kumite.
            </p>

            <p>
              It is important to remember that all classes begin with warm up
              and stretching exercises preparing the body for the four K’s.
            </p>

            <h4>Kihon</h4>
            <p>
              Kihon deals with the execution of basic techniques including
              Blocks, Strikes, Kicks & Stances. They are also performed as
              combinations up and down the dojo called Kihon Ido. Kihon is
              performed after the warm up and should be a regular part of every
              lesson. It develops correct technique, correct body mechanics,
              posture, tension, speed, balance and endurance. Repetition is
              critical to Kihon in order to achieve perfection of technique. It
              is not uncommon to repeat a technique over 50 times in one class
              in an effort to establish correct habits (muscle memory). When
              first attempting Kihon, all movements should be executed slowly
              while establishing correct technique. When the technique is
              correct it should then be executed with speed and focus (Kiai). By
              constant repetition of correct technique at high speed, muscle
              memory is established allowing the student to execute any
              technique spontaneously, with correct form, speed & power. This is
              crucial for real combat, which leaves the mind free to deal with
              situational & strategic issues, rather than the mechanics of the
              technique.
            </p>

            <h4>Kata</h4>
            <p>
              Kata are considered the soul of karatedo and are the foundation of
              the art. They ensure that the most important techniques of
              Goju-Ryu are never forgotten, they are preserved within the kata’s
              which are passed down from generation to generation. They are to
              be practiced thoroughly by both student and master. Although
              kata’s are performed without a partner, they represent a battle
              with multiple imaginary opponents utilizing attacking and
              defensive techniques. The practice of kata leads to the
              development of the physical, intellectual and spiritual self and
              when performed correctly can be classed as a form of moving
              meditation. The movements must be executed at the correct speed
              with a smooth action and finishing with good focus striving for
              technical perfection. Rhythm and timing must be maintained through
              breathing which is considered the tool which links the mind and
              body. The physical benefits of kata include improved coordination,
              balance, speed, focus, muscular control & strength. But most
              importantly, the practice of Kata develops “Mushin - Mind without
              thinking” which is a flow state in which the student and the
              movement become one. It is a state of mind where the student is no
              longer conscious of the activity, they become the activity. This
              mental state is the principle source of the traditional warrior’s
              quick reactions, extrasensory perception, and steely calm. Kata
              through Mushin teaches the student to become one with their
              instincts and have a greater understandin.
            </p>

            <h4>Kumite</h4>
            <p>
              Kumite or sparring is the partner work which allows the student to
              apply the techniques learned in kihon and kata against a real
              opponent. There are two types of kumite; Pre-arranged kumite
              (yakusoku) and free-form kumite (jiyu). Pre-arranged partner work
              is where one opponent has a set attack while the other opponent
              blocks and counters. Pre-arranged kumite consists of one-step, two
              step, three step sparring, fighting techniques & wrist lock
              techniques. These various methods of prearranged sparring restrict
              the student to only one opportunity to demonstrate proper
              technique, target and distance. The attacker learns to make
              single, explosive attacks and learns to reduce telegraphing the
              attacks, while the defender learns to recognise incoming attacks
              and to react accordingly. Pre-arranged kumite is used to develop
              the principles of timing, shifting, control, distance,
              decisiveness, posture and ettiquette. The more advanced form of
              kumite is Free Sparring (Jiyu) which allows the students to move
              freely around the dojo in a free-style posture and stance as
              opposed to the structured pre-arranged sparring. This teaches the
              student to recognize opportunities, take advantage of targets
              presented to them, and react accordingly. Advanced students enter
              Free Sparring with the attitude of “Zanchin - total awareness and
              martial spirit”. It is important to remember that the definition
              of kumite is not to fight, but it implies that two or more people
              are working together, learning from the interaction.
            </p>

            <h4>Kobudo</h4>
            <p>
              Kobudo refers to an Ancient Okinawan weapon art which is not
              formally part of karate-do (open hand martial art). However, the
              development of kobudo weapon training has shadowed the development
              and evolution of karate to the degree that they are almost
              inseparable. Kobudo utilises similar stances, postures and
              fighting strategies as Karate. Therefore Kobudo should not be
              pursued unless the practitioner has a sufficient understanding of
              empty hand martial arts. In the 16th Century the Japanese invaded
              Okinawa and banned the use of weapons, only permitting the
              Japanese Samurai to own weapons in order to control the islands.
              Just as the monks in China had developed weapons from seemingly
              innocent items such as the staff, so did the Okinawans. These
              creative farmers and fisherman resorted to converting the
              implements of their working life into destructive weapons. They
              developed complex weapon forms for such items as the 6 foot staff
              (bo), pitchfork (sai), and the nunchaku was considered a harmless
              tool for grinding rice. It is important to remember that Kobudo
              weapons are based on karate principles. And with proficient
              practice of the chosen weapon the body and weapon will become one,
              making the weapon an extension of the body. Kobudo therefore
              maximises reach and power of all blocks and strikes through the
              use of weapons.

            <p>
              Roubas Goju Ryu Karate has been operating in Sydney since 1983.
              The Chief Instructor, Andrew Roubas Shihan (8th Dan) founded the
              academy over 30 years ago under the guidance of Gonnohyoe Yamamoto
              Soshihan (10th Dan). It is a member dojo of the International
              Karate Organisation (I.K.O.) in Tokyo, Japan.
            </p>
            <p>
              A milestone event occured in 2013 when Andrew Roubas Shihan
              invited Yamamoto Soshihan to visit the Roubas dojo's and perform a
              10day seminar. This placed the Roubas dojos on an international
              stage with a mountain of knowledge being discovered through
              yamamoto’s insights into the world of Goju Ryu. This also allowed
              for Blackbelt gradings for the dojo’s advanced instructors. Many
              of the blackbelts were promoted, most notably Andrew Roubas to 8th
              Dan and the title of Kyoshi, Stefan Roubas to 5th Dan and the
              title of Shihan, and Paul Dovico Sensei to 4th Dan. Shihan Andrew
              Roubas is also qualified in Hapkido (2nd Dan) and Kobudo Weapon
              Training. Shihan Andrew is assisted by a team of high quality
              senior black belts including his son Sensei Stefan Roubas who also
              has over 30 years experience in the martial arts. Shihan Andrew
              Roubas believes the standard of any dojo is directly influenced by
              the quality of it’s senior black belts.
